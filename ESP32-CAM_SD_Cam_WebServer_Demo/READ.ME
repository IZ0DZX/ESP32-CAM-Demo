Working code showing the camera, SD card and Web server all working on the ESP32-CAM board

/capture - will grab an image
/read - reads state of GPIO16
/write?state=ON - pulls GPIO12 up
/write?state=OFF - pulls GPIO12 low

This is a "no-frills" demo used only to demonstrate that it is possible to get everything working at the same time.
